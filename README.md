🎯 **Goal :-** 

To develop an improved **Remote Data Possession Checking (RDPC)** scheme that ensures the **integrity of outsourced data** while maintaining **data privacy**. The scheme specifically aims to designate a **unique verifier** for data integrity checking, avoiding the complexities of **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** and ensuring that the verifier cannot gain any knowledge about the data. 🔐📊  


💡 **Purpose :-**  

✅ **Address Limitations of Existing Systems :-** Current systems either rely on PKI, which involves complex certificate management, or do not provide adequate privacy protection. The proposed scheme overcomes these limitations.  

✅ **Ensure Data Privacy :-** By using **Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC)** and a random integer to blind data integrity proofs, the scheme ensures that the designated verifier cannot access the data content. 🔒🧩  

✅ **Support Dynamic Data Operations :-** The use of a **Merkle Hash Tree (MHT)** structure allows for efficient and dynamic data updates. 🌳📈  

✅ **Improve Efficiency and Security :-** The scheme is designed to be **computationally efficient** and secure against **untrusted Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)** and unauthorized verifiers. ⚙️🔏  


🌟 **Contributions :-**

📌 Implementing an RDPC scheme with a **designated verifier** using **IBC technology**.  
📌 Achieving **data privacy** by blinding data integrity proofs. 🔐  
📌 Supporting **dynamic data operations** with MHT. 🌳📊  
📌 Proving the security of the scheme based on the **Discrete Logarithm Assumption** and the **Computational Diffie-Hellman Assumption**. 🛡️📖  
📌 Demonstrating the **feasibility and efficiency** of the scheme through theoretical analysis and experimental results. 🔍📈
